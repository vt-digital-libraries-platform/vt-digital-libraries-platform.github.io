Virginia Tech is a land-grant university, and its Libraries strive to provide persistent access and preservation to all University digital assets. The Virginia Tech Digital Library Platform (VTDLP) is a cloud-native digital library solution supporting preservation and access. It is a collection of CloudFormation templates, code implementing microservices to support digital library functions such as persistent identifier minting, identifier resolution, file characterization, file fixity validation, and web applications providing user access. The VTDLP accepts content from our institutional repository VTechWorks, our Special Collections and University Archives, our Digital Imaging Lab, and individual faculty and student researchers. It is also in development to accept content from the Virginia Tech Data Repository and learning objects repository Odyssey in the future.

The Virginia Tech Digital Libraries Platform’s mission is to preserve and provide access to data, support knowledge, discovery, and creativity by maintaining Virginia Tech’s contributions to the scholarly record. The VTDLP’s mission in preserving and providing access to data is inspired by our land-grant identity and guided by our motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve), and stems from the Virginia Tech University Libraries (VTUL) Mission: “We enable people to cultivate ideas, develop capacities, and create knowledge. Users do this through the University Libraries’ provision of collections, expertise, services, and environments.”
